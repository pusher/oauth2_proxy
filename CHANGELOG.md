# Vx.x.x (Pre-release)

## Release Highlights

## Important Notes

- [#1086](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/1086) The extra validation to protect invalid session
  deserialization from v6.0.0 (only) has been removed to improve performance. If you are on v6.0.0, either upgrade
  to a version before this first and allow legacy sessions to expire gracefully or change your `cookie-secret`
  value and force all sessions to reauthenticate.

- GitLab provider now supports restricting to members of a project
- Keycloak provider now supports restricting users to members of a set of groups
- (Alpha) Flexible header configuration allowing user defined mapping of session claims to header values


## Important Notes

- [GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2) The whitelist domain feature has been updated to fix a vulnerability that was identified, please see the linked advisory for details
- [#964](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/964) Redirect URL generation will attempt secondary strategies
  in the priority chain if any fail the `IsValidRedirect` security check. Previously any failures fell back to `/`.
- [#953](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/953) Keycloak will now use `--profile-url` if set for the userinfo endpoint
  instead of `--validate-url`. `--validate-url` will still work for backwards compatibility.
- [#957](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/957) To use X-Forwarded-{Proto,Host,Uri} on redirect detection, `--reverse-proxy` must be `true`.
- [#936](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/936) `--user-id-claim` option is deprecated and replaced by `--oidc-email-claim`
- [#630](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/630) Gitlab projects needs a Gitlab application with the extra `read_api` enabled
- [#849](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/849) `/oauth2/auth` `allowed_groups` querystring parameter can be paired with the `allowed-groups` configuration option.
  - The `allowed_groups` querystring parameter can specify multiple comma delimited groups.
  - In this scenario, the user must have a group (from their multiple groups) present in both lists to not get a 401 or 403 response code.
  - Example:
    - OAuth2-Proxy globally sets the `allowed_groups` as `engineering`.
    - An application using Kubernetes ingress uses the `/oauth2/auth` endpoint with `allowed_groups` querystring set to `backend`.
    - A user must have a session with the groups `["engineering", "backend"]` to pass authorization.
    - Another user with the groups `["engineering", "frontend"]` would fail the querystring authorization portion.
- [#905](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/905) Existing sessions from v6.0.0 or earlier are no longer valid. They will trigger a reauthentication.
- [#826](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/826) `skip-auth-strip-headers` now applies to all requests, not just those where authentication would be skipped.
- [#797](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/797) The behavior of the Google provider Groups restriction changes with this
  - Either `--google-group` or the new `--allowed-group` will work for Google now (`--google-group` will be used if both are set)
  - Group membership lists will be passed to the backend with the `X-Forwarded-Groups` header
  - If you change the list of allowed groups, existing sessions that now don't have a valid group will be logged out immediately.
    - Previously, group membership was only checked on session creation and refresh.
- [#789](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/789) `--skip-auth-route` is (almost) backwards compatible with `--skip-auth-regex`
  - We are marking `--skip-auth-regex` as DEPRECATED and will remove it in the next major version.
  - If your regex contains an `=` and you want it for all methods, you will need to add a leading `=` (this is the area where `--skip-auth-regex` doesn't port perfectly)
- [#575](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/575) Sessions from v5.1.1 or earlier will no longer validate since they were not signed with SHA1.
  - Sessions from v6.0.0 or later had a graceful conversion to SHA256 that resulted in no reauthentication
  - Upgrading from v5.1.1 or earlier will result in a reauthentication
- [#616](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/616) Ensure you have configured oauth2-proxy to use the `groups` scope.
  - The user may be logged out initially as they may not currently have the `groups` claim however after going back through login process wil be authenticated.
- [#839](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/839) Enables complex data structures for group claim entries, which are output as Json by default.

## Breaking Changes

- [#964](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/964) `--reverse-proxy` must be true to trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers as canonical.
  These are used throughout the application in redirect URLs, cookie domains and host logging logic. These are the headers:
  - `X-Forwarded-Proto` instead of `req.URL.Scheme`
  - `X-Forwarded-Host` instead of `req.Host`
  - `X-Forwarded-Uri` instead of `req.URL.RequestURI()`
- [#953](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/953) In config files & envvar configs, `keycloak_group` is now the plural `keycloak_groups`.
  Flag configs are still `--keycloak-group` but it can be passed multiple times.
- [#911](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/911) Specifying a non-existent provider will cause OAuth2-Proxy to fail on startup instead of defaulting to "google".
- [#797](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/797) Security changes to Google provider group authorization flow
  - If you change the list of allowed groups, existing sessions that now don't have a valid group will be logged out immediately.
    - Previously, group membership was only checked on session creation and refresh.
- [#722](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/722) When a Redis session store is configured, OAuth2-Proxy will fail to start up unless connection and health checks to Redis pass
- [#800](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/800) Fix import path for v7. The import path has changed to support the go get installation.
  - You can now `go get github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7` to get the latest `v7` version of OAuth2 Proxy
  - Import paths for package are now under `v7`, eg `github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7/pkg/<module>`
- [#753](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/753) A bug in the Azure provider prevented it from properly passing the configured protected `--resource`
  via the login url. If this option was used in the past, behavior will change with this release as it will
  affect the tokens returned by Azure. In the past, the tokens were always for `https://graph.microsoft.com` (the default)
  and will now be for the configured resource (if it exists, otherwise it will run into errors)
- [#754](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/754) The Azure provider now has token refresh functionality implemented. This means that there won't
  be any redirects in the browser anymore when tokens expire, but instead a token refresh is initiated
  in the background, which leads to new tokens being returned in the cookies.
  - Please note that `--cookie-refresh` must be 0 (the default) or equal to the token lifespan configured in Azure AD to make
    Azure token refresh reliable. Setting this value to 0 means that it relies on the provider implementation
    to decide if a refresh is required.

# v6.0.0

## Release Highlights

- Migrated to an independent GitHub organisation
- Added local test environment examples using docker-compose and kind
- Error pages will now be rendered when upstream connections fail
- Non-Existent options in config files will now return errors on startup
- Sessions are now always encrypted, independent of configuration

## Important Notes

- (Security) Fix for [open redirect vulnerability](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-5m6c-jp6f-2vcv).
  - More invalid redirects that lead to open-redirects were reported
  - An extensive test suite has been added to prevent future regressions
- [#453](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/453) Responses to endpoints with a proxy prefix will now return headers for preventing browser caching.

## Breaking Changes

- [#464](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/464) Migration from Pusher to independent org may have introduced breaking changes for your environment.
  - See the changes listed below for PR [#464](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/464) for full details
  - Binaries renamed from `oauth2_proxy` to `oauth2-proxy`
- [#440](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/440) Switch Azure AD Graph API to Microsoft Graph API
  - The Azure AD Graph API has been [deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) and is being replaced by the Microsoft Graph API.
    If your application relies on the access token being passed to it to access the Azure AD Graph API, you should migrate your application to use the Microsoft Graph API.
    Existing behaviour can be retained by setting `-resource=https://graph.windows.net`.
- [#484](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/484) Configuration loading has been replaced with Viper and PFlag
  - Flags now require a `--` prefix before the option
  - Previously flags allowed either `-` or `--` to prefix the option name
  - Eg `-provider` must now be `--provider`
- [#487](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/487) Switch flags to StringSlice instead of StringArray
  - Options that take multiple arguments now split strings on commas if present
  - Eg `--foo=a,b,c,d` would result in the values `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` instead of a single `a,b,c,d` value as before
- [#535](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/535) Drop support for pre v3.1 cookies
  - The encoding for session cookies was changed starting in v3.1.0, support for the previous encoding is now dropped
  - If you are upgrading from a version earlier than this, please upgrade via a version between v3.1.0 and v5.1.1
- [#537](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/537) Drop Fallback to Email if User not set
  - Previously, when a session was loaded, if the User was not set, it would be replaced by the Email.
    This behaviour was inconsistent as it required the session to be stored and then loaded to function properly.
  - This behaviour has now been removed and the User field will remain empty if it was not set when the session was saved.
  - In some scenarios `X-Forwarded-User` will now be empty. Use `X-Forwarded-Email` instead.
  - In some scenarios, this may break setting Basic Auth on upstream or responses.
    Use `--prefer-email-to-user` to restore falling back to the Email in these cases.
- [#556](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/556) Remove unintentional auto-padding of secrets that were too short
  - Previously, after cookie-secrets were opportunistically base64 decoded to raw bytes,
    they were padded to have a length divisible by 4.
  - This led to wrong sized secrets being valid AES lengths of 16, 24, or 32 bytes. Or it led to confusing errors
    reporting an invalid length of 20 or 28 when the user input cookie-secret was not that length.
  - Now we will only base64 decode a cookie-secret to raw bytes if it is 16, 24, or 32 bytes long. Otherwise, we will convert
    the direct cookie-secret to bytes without silent padding added.
- [#412](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/412)/[#559](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/559) Allow multiple cookie domains to be specified
  - Multiple cookie domains may now be configured. The longest domain that matches will be used.
  - The config options `cookie_domain` is now `cookie_domains`
  - The environment variable `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is now `OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_DOMAINS`
- [#414](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/414) Always encrypt sessions regardless of config
  - Previously, sessions were encrypted only when certain options were configured.
    This lead to confusion and misconfiguration as it was not obvious when a session should be encrypted.
  - Cookie Secrets must now be 16, 24 or 32 bytes.
  - If you need to change your secret, this will force users to reauthenticate.
- [#548](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/548) Separate logging options out of main options structure
  - Fixes an inconsistency in the `--exclude-logging-paths` option by renaming it to `--exclude-logging-option`.
  - This flag may now be given multiple times as with other list options
  - This flag also accepts comma separated values
- [#639](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/639) Change how gitlab-group is parsed on options
  - Previously, the flag gitlab-group used comma seperated values, while the config option used space seperated values.
  - This fixes the config value to use slices internally.
  - The config option `gitlab_group` is now `gitlab_groups`
  - The environment variable `OAUTH2_PROXY_GITLAB_GROUP` is now `OAUTH2_PROXY_GITLAB_GROUPS`

# v5.0.0

## Release Highlights

- Disabled CGO (binaries will work regardless og glibc/musl)
- Allow whitelisted redirect ports
- Nextcloud provider support added

  - This PR adds the IDToken into the session for the Azure provider allowing requests to a backend to be identified as a specific user. As a consequence, if you are using a cookie to store the session the cookie will now exceed the 4kb size limit and be split into multiple cookies. This can cause problems when using nginx as a proxy, resulting in no cookie being passed at all. Either increase the proxy_buffer_size in nginx or implement the redis session storage (see https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration#redis-storage)

## Release Highlights

- Documentation is now on a [microsite](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/)
- Health check logging can now be disabled for quieter logs
- Authorization Header JWTs can now be verified by the proxy to skip authentication for machine users
- Sessions can now be stored in Redis. This reduces refresh failures and uses smaller cookies (Recommended for those using OIDC refreshing)
- Logging overhaul allows customisable logging formats

- This release includes a number of breaking changes that will require users to
  reconfigure their proxies. Please read the Breaking Changes below thoroughly.

## Breaking Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/231) Rework GitLab provider
  - This PR changes the configuration options for the GitLab provider to use
    a self-hosted instance. You now need to specify a `-oidc-issuer-url` rather than
    explicit `-login-url`, `-redeem-url` and `-validate-url` parameters.
- [#186](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/186) Make config consistent
  - This PR changes configuration options so that all flags have a config counterpart
    of the same name but with underscores (`_`) in place of hyphens (`-`).
    This change affects the following flags:
  - The `--tls-key` flag is now `--tls-key-file` to be consistent with existing
    file flags and the existing config and environment settings
  - The `--tls-cert` flag is now `--tls-cert-file` to be consistent with existing
    file flags and the existing config and environment settings
    This change affects the following existing configuration options:
  - The `proxy-prefix` option is now `proxy_prefix`.
    This PR changes environment variables so that all flags have an environment
    counterpart of the same name but capitalised, with underscores (`_`) in place
    of hyphens (`-`) and with the prefix `OAUTH2_PROXY_`.
    This change affects the following existing environment variables:
  - The `OAUTH2_SKIP_OIDC_DISCOVERY` environment variable is now `OAUTH2_PROXY_SKIP_OIDC_DISCOVERY`.
  - The `OAUTH2_OIDC_JWKS_URL` environment variable is now `OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_JWKS_URL`.
- [#146](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/146) Use full email address as `User` if the auth response did not contain a `User` field
  - This change modifies the contents of the `X-Forwarded-User` header supplied by the proxy for users where the auth response from the IdP did not contain
    a username.
    In that case, this header used to only contain the local part of the user's email address (e.g. `john.doe` for `john.doe@example.com`) but now contains
    the user's full email address instead.
- [#170](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/170) Pre-built binary tarballs changed format
  - The pre-built binary tarballs again match the format of the [bitly](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy) repository, where the unpacked directory
    has the same name as the tarball and the binary is always named `oauth2_proxy`. This was done to restore compatibility with third-party automation
    recipes like https://github.com/jhoblitt/puppet-oauth2_proxy.

# v3.1.0

## Release highlights

- Introduction of ARM releases and and general improvements to Docker builds
- Improvements to OIDC provider allowing pass-through of ID Tokens
- Multiple redirect domains can now be whitelisted
- Streamed responses are now flushed periodically

## Important notes

- If you have been using [#bitly/621](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy/pull/621)
  and have cookies larger than the 4kb limit,
  the cookie splitting pattern has changed and now uses `_` in place of `-` when
  indexing cookies.
  This will force users to reauthenticate the first time they use `v3.1.0`.
- Streamed responses will now be flushed every 1 second by default.
  Previously streamed responses were flushed only when the buffer was full.
  To retain the old behaviour set `--flush-interval=0`.
  See [#23](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/23) for further details.
